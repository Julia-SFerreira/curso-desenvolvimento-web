                <p>Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
                    High heels on cobblestones<br>
                    When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
                    Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
                    Sensual politics<br>

                <p>But I knew you<br>
                    Dancin' in your Levi's<br>
                    Drunk under a streetlight, I<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
                    Baby, kiss it better, I</p>

                <p>And when I felt like I was an old cardigan<br>
                    Under someone's bed<br>
                    You put me on and said I was your favorite</p>

                    When you are young, they assume you know nothin'</p>

                <p>But I knew you<br>
                    Playing hide-and-seek and<br>
                    Giving me your weekends, I<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
                    Once in 20 lifetimes, I</p>

                <h2>Terceira Parte</h2>
                <p>To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
                    Was all we needed<br>
                    You drew stars around my scars<br>
                    But now I'm bleedin'<br>
                    'Cause I knew you<br>
                    Steppin' on the last train<br>
                    Marked me like a bloodstain, I<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Tried to change the ending<br>
                    Peter losing Wendy, I<br>
                    I knew you<br>
                    Leavin' like a father<br>
                    Running like water, I<br>
                    And when you are young, they assume you know nothing</p>

                <h2>Ponte</h2>
                <p>But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
                    I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
                    The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
                    'Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
                    I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
                    Chasin' shadows in the grocery line<br>
                    I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
                    And you'd be standin' in my front porch light<br>
                    And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
                    You'd come back to me<br>
                    And you'd come back to me<br>
                    And you'd come back</p>
